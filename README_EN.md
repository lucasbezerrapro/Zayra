2. pyttsx3
`pyttsx3` is a library for text-to-speech conversion. You can install it with the following command:


3. Webbrowser
The `webbrowser` module allows opening web pages. It is usually **already included in the default Python installation**, so **no need to install it separately**.

4. OS (operating system)
The `os` module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It is not necessary to install it as it is already part of the Python standard library.

5. Random
The `random` module is used to generate random numbers. It is also part of the standard library, so **no additional installation is required**.

6. threading
`threading` is used to create threads. It is part of the Python standard library, so **no separate installation is required**.

7. MoviePy
`moviepy` is a library for video editing. Install it using:


8. Tkinter
Tkinter is a graphical library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. Most Python distributions already include Tkinter, but if it is not present, you can install it with:


9. PIL (Pillow)
The PIL (Pillow) module is used for image manipulation. Install it with the following command:


10. pygame
 `pygame` is a library for game development in Python. Install it using:

 ```

12. sys
 The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter. It is an integrated part of the standard library, so **no additional installation is required**.

After installing these dependencies, you will be ready to use the script that makes use of these libraries. Make sure you are in a virtual environment if you are using one to avoid version and dependency conflicts.
